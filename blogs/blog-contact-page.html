                <h1 class="title-1">What is Html?</h1>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web
                    applications. It is not a programming language but a markup language that defines the structure of
                    your content.</p><br>
                <p>The current version of HTML is HTML5, officially released in October 2014.</p><br>
                <p>HTML is the standard language for creating web pages, serving as the foundational building block for
                    web content. It provides the essential structure and layout for web pages, which is then enhanced
                    and styled by CSS and made interactive with JavaScript.</p><br>

                <h1 class="title-1">Setting Up a Basic HTML File</h1>
                <p>I don’t recommend the traditional Notepad approach for creating HTML files. It’s too basic and lacks
                    the features needed for efficient web development.</p><br>
                <ul class="unorder-list">
                    <li><strong>Step-1: Install Visual Studio Code:</strong> Start by installing Visual Studio Code (VS
                        Code). It’s a powerful and popular code editor that offers many features beneficial for web
                        development.</li><br>
                    <li><strong> Create a Project Folder:</strong> On your computer, choose a convenient location like
                        your desktop, and create a new folder. Name it something like ‘html-practice’ to signify its
                        purpose.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Open the Folder in VS Code:</strong> Launch Visual Studio Code and open the
                        ‘html-practice’ folder. This step is crucial as it helps you organize your work and use the
                        powerful features of VS Code.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Step-4: Create an HTML File:</strong> Inside the ‘html-practice’ folder, create a new
                        file. Name it with an .html extension, such as index.html. This is your HTML file where you will
                        write your HTML code.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Step-5: Open the HTML File in VS Code:</strong> Open the ‘index.html’ file in VS Code.
                        You can now start writing your HTML code in the editor.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Step-6: Start Coding:</strong> Now, with your index.html file open in VS Code, you can
                        start writing your HTML code. VS Code will provide syntax highlighting and other helpful tools
                        to make your coding more efficient.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Step-7: Preview Your Web Page:</strong> As you write your HTML code, it’s important to
                        frequently preview your web page. In Visual Studio Code, you can use extensions like “Live
                        Server” to view your web page in real-time. This tool automatically refreshes the page in your
                        browser whenever you save changes, allowing you to immediately see the impact of your code.</li>

                <h1 class="title-1">HTML Structure</h1>
                <p>Understanding the structure of an HTML document is crucial for effective web development. Every HTML
                    page begins with a DOCTYPE declaration, which is essential in informing the web browser about the
                    version of HTML the page is written in. Over the years, as HTML has evolved, the DOCTYPE has changed
                    to reflect different versions. In HTML5, the latest version, the DOCTYPE declaration is simplified
                    to:</p>

                <img src="images/carbon.png" alt="!DOCTYPE html-pic" class="carbon1-img">

                <p>This line must be placed at the very top of your HTML document. It is a declaration rather than a
                    tag, and it ensures that your HTML code is interpreted correctly by different
                    browsers.<br><br>Following the DOCTYPE declaration, an HTML document is structured into two main
                    sections: the head and the body</p><br>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The Head Section head: This part of the document contains meta-information about the document, which isn't displayed directly on the web page. It includes elements such as the title of the document, links to stylesheets, meta tags for SEO, and scripts. The title tag within the head is particularly important as it defines the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.</li><br>
                        <li>The Body Section body: This is where the content that will be displayed to users on the webpage is placed. It can contain various elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and more. Essentially, whatever you want to show to the users on your webpage will be a part of the body.</li><br>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="title-1">Here’s a basic example of an HTML5 document structure:</h3>
                    <img src="images/carbon (1).png" alt="html- structure" class="carbon2-img">

                    <p>In this structure, <html> acts as the root element that encapsulates the entire content of the web page. It’s important to remember that while the <head> section contains information about the document, the <body> section contains the actual content that will be visible to your web page visitors.</p>
